This project is a Heart Disease Detection System that uses machine learning to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient data. The model is trained using the Heart Disease dataset and includes preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.
Features:
          * Data loading and exploration
          * Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, encoding)
          * Machine learning model training
          * Performance evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
          * Data visualization for insights

Technologies Used:
          * Python
          * Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
          * Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
          * Scikit-Learn for machine learning

Dataset:
      * The dataset contains medical attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, and more.
      * The target column indicates 0 (No Heart Disease) or 1 (Has Heart Disease).
