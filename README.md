Project Objective:
"The Heart Disease Detection System is a machine learning-based model that predicts whether a patient has heart disease based on medical parameters. The system is trained using a dataset containing various health indicators and is evaluated based on multiple performance metrics."

Step-by-Step Explanation of the Project:

1. Data Collection and Loading
                    The dataset used in this project contains essential medical information such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, and more.
It is loaded using Pandas to analyze and prepare it for further processing.

2. Data Preprocessing:
                   Handling Missing Values: Missing or null values are identified and handled using techniques like filling with median values or dropping irrelevant data.
Feature Scaling: Since medical attributes have different numerical ranges, StandardScaler is used to normalize the data for better model performance.
Categorical Encoding: If categorical variables exist, they are converted into numerical representations.

3. Splitting Data for Training and Testing:
                  The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets using train_test_split from Scikit-Learn.
This ensures that the model learns from one portion of the data and is tested on unseen data.

4. Model Selection and Training:
                  Various machine learning algorithms can be implemented, such as:
                                                                 Logistic Regression (default model used),
                                                                  Random Forest Classifier and
                                                                  Support Vector Machine (SVM)
                                                                  The chosen model is trained on the training dataset to recognize patterns in the data.

5. Model Evaluation:
                 After training, the model's accuracy is evaluated using:
Accuracy Score: Measures overall correctness.
Confusion Matrix: Provides detailed classification results (True Positives, False Positives, etc.).
Classification Report: Includes precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the modelâ€™s performance.

6. Results and Interpretation:
                The model produces an accuracy score of around 85%, meaning it correctly predicts heart disease presence in most cases.
The confusion matrix shows how many correct and incorrect predictions were made.
The classification report helps in fine-tuning the model by adjusting hyperparameters.

7. Future Enhancements:
                Implementing advanced machine learning models such as Neural Networks.
Deploying the model using Flask or Streamlit for real-world usage.
Optimizing hyperparameters for improved accuracy.
